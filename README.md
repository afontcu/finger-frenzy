# Finger Frenzy

Finger Frenzy is a quite stupid game that I really loved when I was younger.
I discovered it long time ago in some random page with hundreds of small games.

You can play it here: https://finger-frenzy.netlify.app/


## What is Finger Frenzy about

Just try to type the alphabet (ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ) as fast as you can.
That's it (for now).


## Why should I do that?

Dunno. It's just a game.


## Why so little serious?

Because we need to "[make Frontend Shit Again](https://makefrontendshitagain.party/)", as
said by [Sara Vieria](https://twitter.com/nikkitaftw).

While Finger Frenzy is not *that* shit, this is the idea:

_"We used to make websites because it was fun and at a point we lost the way. We need to make dumb shit! Make useless stuff; make the web fun again!"_


## I want to contribute

Lol then I love you. Feel free to submit issues or PRs. I'll happily discuss
any idea, improvement or tweak.

## Roadmap

Well, "roadmap"....

- [ ] Add a leaderboard! (mostly because I wanna play with GraphQL)
- [ ] Make it PWA so you can play it offline
- [ ] Make it work in mobile
- [ ] Hard mode (reverse alphabet? skipping certain letters?)
