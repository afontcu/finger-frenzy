# Finger Frenzy

Finger Frenzy is a quite stupid game that I really loved when I was younger.

I discovered in some random page with hundreds of small games, and it looked like 
a great opportunity to sharpen my React skills.


## What is it about

Well, is not that hard, is it? Just try to type the alphabet
(ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ) as fast as you can.


## Why so little serious?

Because I support the "[Make Frontend Shit Again](https://makefrontendshitagain.party/)"
movement by [Sara Vieria](https://twitter.com/nikkitaftw).

While Finger Frenzy is not *that* shit, I truly believe this words:

_"We used to make websites because it was fun and at a point we lost the way. We need to make dumb shit! Make useless stuff; make the web fun again!"_


## Why should I do that?

Dunno. It's just a game.


## I want to contribute

Lol then I love you. Feel free to submit issues or PRs. I'll happily discuss
any idea, improvement or tweak.
